//TODO:
 1- execute send instruction
 2- Simulator should give next state based on given state
 3- log sequence of executed states
 4- execute sequence based on given log
 5- multiple actors testcase

//TODO:
 1- add parameter for message call
 2- create a monitor for each rebec with mapping
 3- Monitor: {
    monitoring_queue
    shared_queue -> for its actor

    fun main
    fun receive_regular_message(message)
    fun receive_monitoring_message(message)
 }
 4- new Simulator & actor(monitor)

//TODO:
0- increment vc after each instruction
1- send vc for each message
2- update actor vc while taking new message
3- read csv file and create table for each actors

//TODO:
1- test vc

//TODO:
1- add log of vc
2- add delay for message sending & execution
3- measure -> ask & tell count total - per property
4- measure -> avg time for every process between ask & tell
5- measure -> avg time for all process between ask & tell
6- at declare time -> history size of each monitor
7- test algorithm with log
