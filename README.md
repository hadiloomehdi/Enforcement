## Real-Time Verification and Evaluation for Rebeca Language

### Introduction
[Rebeca](http://rebeca-lang.org/) is an actor-based language used for formal verification. 
We created a tool that runs Rebeca code in run-time and evaluates its correctness based on a complex algorithm and some policies.

### Running
For running this project, you need to add Rebeca [Compiler manually](https://github.com/rebeca-lang/org.rebecalang.compiler/blob/master/target/compiler-2.7.3.jar?raw=true) as a library of your project.
